## Game Rules

Basic rules from [Quoridor Strats](https://quoridorstrats.wordpress.com/beginners-guide-rules-and-basics/)

* The game is played on a 9x9 board
* There are 2 players
* Each player starts with a pawn and ten walls
* Each turn is either moving the player's pawn OR placing a wall
* Pawns move up, down, left, or right
* Once placed, walls cannot be moved
* There should always be a path for the players to reach the goal


## Plan
### Stage 1
A simple 2 player (no AI) implementation to play in console.
